FinTech companies usually distinguish themselves from traditional financial institutions by taking technologically innovative approaches to complement or replace financial services. Switzerland is particularly well developed in the financial industry and has earned the reputation of being a trustworthy and innovative financial hub. Together with a technology-neutral2 and innovation-friendly regulatory approach, it has created a fertile ground for a world-class FinTech centre to develop. In fact, Zurich and Geneva currently rank as the second and fourth FinTech hubs in the world3 . In 2021, 3844 FinTech companies are operating in Switzerland, and among them are 14 unicorns5 (including 11 based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and every tenth FinTech startup is founded in Switzerland6. In this booklet, we explore how recent developments in financial regulation have impacted innovation in the Swiss FinTech scene. To this end, we begin by giving a general introduction to FinTechs and their regulation in Switzerland (Chapter 2). We then detail recent developments in financial markets regulation through the lens of robo-advisory, an A.I.-based asset manager. In particular, we study the introduction of FinSA7, FinIA8, and FADP9. To gain more insight into artificial intelligence-based asset management, we provide pseudocode for a simplified robo-advisor (Chapter 3). We then nuance our discussion by exploring recent developments in distributed ledger technology (Chapter 4), as well as the current state of regulation in Europe’s second FinTech hub, the United Kingdom (U.K.) (Chapter 5). We finally turn to the voices of the industry through the video interviews of three Zurich based FinTechs: Descartes Finance AG, Relai AG and House of Satoshi (Chapter 6). These interviews are available through their respective hyperlinks.

Banking has become a symbol of Switzerland and has been a driving force in cementing its position as one of the financial centres of the world10 . In parallel, Switzerland is also famously recognised as being the most innovative and innovation-friendly countries world-wide11. In 2015, the Confederacy officially earned this title of by ranking first in the Global Innovation Index12, and has held it ever since. According to the European Innovation Scoreboard13, Switzerland’s biggest strengths lie in attractive research systems, human resources and intellectual assets. Indeed, it is home to some of the best universities in the world including two of the top 20 best technical universities14 (ETH and EPFL). It is also the country filing the most patent requests per million inhabitants in Europe15; in 2021 Switzerland filed 969 patent applications. Holding the second position, Sweden only filed 488. The government has fostered this innovative environment over the years, creating Swiss Innovation parks16 across the country to “strengthen its position as a leader in innovation and maintain the country’s economic competitiveness”. The place occupied by Switzerland in the FinTech scene is the fruit of strategic engineering: the government has recognised the value of the association of these two emblematic forces, and, in an effort to maintain its position in the FinTech hub ranking, Switzerland is becoming a pioneer in the FinTech world and FinTech legislation (see 2.2). This first chapter covers the Swiss FinTech scene (infra 1.1.1) and its general regulations (infra 1.1.2), and, in a case-study approach, dives into the leading A.I.-based wealthTech robo-advisory. 3.1.1 The FinTech Market FinTechs are notoriously hard to number, due to the blurred lines there may be between FinTechs that identify as such and the emergence of traditional institutions that increasingly deliver technology-backed financial services17. Colloquially, FinTechs may be defined as companies that apply innovative technology in the delivery of financial services18. As such, they can be classified based on these two criteria; their technology in use and service delivered19. Figure 120 In 2021, 382 FinTech companies are operating in Switzerland, most of them in the investment management space (n=150) and using process digitization or automation technologies (n=169). 2021 is the first year the total company count has decreased with a negative growth of 5.2%, corresponding to a net loss of 21 businesses. However, both the median number of employees and median funding of the remaining 382 companies in operation increased21. Indeed, the number of deals rose by close to 30% of its previous four-year average making 2021 a record funding year22. 3.1.1.1 FinTech Classification In terms of technology area, FinTechs may be broken down into process automatization/digitization, DLT, analytics/A.I. and quantum computing. To this day, no quantum computing FinTech exists in Switzerland. The most important of all three areas is therefore the automation/digitization category, followed by A.I. and Analytics. While the number of DLT and process automation firms have seen a contraction in the past year, A.I. and Analytics is the sole technology area that continues to grow in 202123. By product area, the market may be broken down into the payment, investment management, deposit and lending, and banking infrastructure categories. None of these categories are perfectly hermetic. According to this study, investment management is the most important segment amounting to 40% of the total FinTechs24. Figure 225 The largest crossroads between technology and product area is the combination of investment management and A.I., representing about 15% of all FinTech companies. In fact, 60% of all AI-based FinTechs operate in the investment management space, with the flagship A.I. process in WealthTech being Robo-advisory, algorithm-based asset management (1.2). When comparing the Swiss FinTech scene internationally, the Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen Zug (IFZ) study found that Swiss FinTech is on average more active in the investment management product area and in the A.I. and DLT technologies26. 3.1.2 General FinTech Regulation In this body of work, we have chosen to restrict ourselves to the presentation of the Swiss regulations. Thus, we assume that the FinTech company is based in Switzerland and offers services to individuals or legal entities in Switzerland and therefore omit transnational aspects. The notion of FinTech is not defined in Swiss law27. Following the IFZ subdivision in section 1.1.1, FinTechs can fall into several categories at the same time depending on the services they offer. Furthermore, FinTechs are not specifically regulated. There are no specific prohibitions or restrictions on FinTech companies or cryptocurrency-related activities28. This, however, does not imply that FinTechs are exempt from any regulation. On the contrary; all regulations are potentially applicable. Therefore, multiple laws play a role in the development of a FinTech company. In particular, all federal laws and implementing ordinances governing financial services are potentially applicable. Indeed, pursuant to Art. 98 Par. 1 and 2 Cst., the Confederation has the capacity to legislate in the area of financial markets. In addition, circulars and other directives issued by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) as well as regulations issued by private organizations are likely to apply. Thus, data protection law, corporate law, contract law and tax law are among the legal areas that will influence the organisation of a FinTech29. It is thus necessary to examine on a case-by-case basis which laws may potentially apply to a FinTech30. FinTech companies may hence fall within the scope of the laws mentioned below, all of which are mentioned in Art. 1 Par. 1 FINMASA, depending on their activities: Mortgage Bond Act of 25 June 1930 (CC 211.423.4); Federal Act on Contracts of Insurance of 2 April 1908 (CC 221.229.1); Collective Investment Schemes Act of 23 June 2006 (CISA, CC 951.31); Banking Act of 8 November 1934 (BA, CC 952.0); Financial Institutions Act of 15 June 2018 (FinIA, CC 954.1); Anti-Money Laundering Act of 10 October 1997 (AMLA, CC 955.0); Insurance Supervision Act of 17 December 2004 (ISA, CC 961.01); Financial Market Infrastructure Act of 19 June 2015 (FMIA, CC 958.1); Financial Services Act of 15 June 2018 (FinSA, CC 950.1). According to Art. 1 Par. 1 FINMASA, the Confederation shall establish an authority to supervise in accordance with the above acts. Therefore, FinTechs may be subject to regulation and supervision by FINMA or self-regulatory organisations due to the nature and scope of their business activities31. FinTechs must ensure that they comply with the financial regulations applicable to their business model prior to any activity and ensure that they obtain any necessary authorizations or face administrative or criminal sanctions32. According to the Federal Court, the main objectives of the financial market legislation are the protection of investors and the fairness of the capital market33. The laws mentioned above address these general objectives. Thus, these regulations aim to protect both the function of the financial market (Funktionsschutz) and the participants in that market (Kundenschutz)34. The two goals are closely linked and they are also relevant for FinTech35. The purpose of the protection of the function of financial markets (Funktionsschutz) is to ensure that the financial market, as an institution, remains operational and to prevent it from failing. In this way, the confidence of market participants is guaranteed, allowing them to continue investing and trading. The protection of the function of financial markets aims also to minimize systemic risks. That is to say, to reduce the risks due to the interconnections between the different actors of the financial market since the bankruptcy of one can have a negative impact on the others36. The protection of market participants covers investors, creditors and insureds. This protection is initially based on the idea that financial market participants are in a weaker economic position and are less well informed than institutions and therefore require greater protection 37. Further, the rules of Swiss financial market law are adopted following several general principles of legislative technique: First, financial regulation is based on principles or rules. This means that the objective and principles of regulation are defined by the legislator, but not the manner of achieving the goal. Such an approach strikes a balance between the economic freedom of business and legal certainty. The Swiss legislator sometimes moves away from purely principle-based regulation to a mixed approach between principles and rules 38. Secondly, Swiss regulation is also based on the risks presented by the activities of financial entities and products since the legislator is not in a position to regulate and monitor all activities. Such regulation has a preventive effect. It consists, in the first instance, of identifying the risks that need to be regulated. In a second step, it is a matter of determining what level of risk can be reasonably taken by an entity. Once the threshold is exceeded, measures to prevent the risk from happening must be taken 39. Third, the regulation seeks to be as technologically neutral as possible (technology-neutral)40. This means that regulation should not differ depending on the technology used to carry out an activity41. This implies that activities with the same level of risk should be regulated in the same way regardless of the technology used. This is an essential principle that allows the principles of proportionality (Art. 5 Cst.) and economic freedom (Art. 27 and 94 Cst.) of financial market participants to be respected42. It also creates a level playing field between innovators and traditional providers who engage in comparable activities and presents similar risks43 Finally, financial regulation can be based on an activity-based approach or an entity-based approach. In Switzerland, the legislator has traditionally regulated certain sectors of the financial market. However, the legislator has recently favored regulating the financial system in a cross-sectoral manner44. This is what the legislator has done by adopting the FinIA and the FinSA, two laws that are of particular interest to us in this work. FINMA is open to an innovation-friendly and technology-neutral approach. Similarly, Swiss policymakers have affirmed a liberal strategy regarding the regulation of new technologies in the FinTech sector45. On 1 January 2020, two financial market laws, the FinSA and the FinIA, entered into force. They will be detailed through the lens of robo-advisory in section 2.1 In addition, on September 25, 2020, the Parliament approved the new Federal Act on the Adaptation of Federal Law to Developments in Distributed Electronic Register Technology (DLT Act), detailed in 2.2. Finally, from September 2023, the new revised federal law on data protection (DPA) will come into force, also examined in 1.2.1. 3.1.2.1 FinTech-specific Incentives The government keeps the digitalisation central to its economic competitiveness strategy46. As such, it has developed favourable conditions for the FinTech industry beyond its federal positive legislation to ease regulatory hurdles based on three pillars47. These reforms were initiated by the Federal council in 2016 through the Bank Ordinance, with the two first pillars coming into effect on August 1st 2017, and the last on January 1st 2019. First Pillar: Funding Funding is abundant in Switzerland, from seeds to traditional financial institutions eager to buy an equity stake in later stage companies48. In particular, Crowdfunding has shown rapid growth recently: the first crowdfunding platform in Switzerland was founded in 2008 and the number increased from 4 platforms in 2014 to over 38 today49. CHF 2.23 billion has been raised through crowdfunding since 200850. In per capita crowdfunding volumes, Switzerland is operating at ⅔ of the volume of the USA51. Relai, whose founder and CEO Julian Liniger we interviewed for this paper, is currently using the crowdfunding platform Crowdcube for a crowdfunding round. With 25 days to go, they’re already gathered 126% of their target, raising EUR 1,901,210 from 409 unique investors. This increase in crowdfunding was engineered by the legislator, facilitating conditions through the introduction of the FinTech regulation on August 1st 2017. This was done through the following amendment in the Bank Act that extended the holding period through crowdfunding that does not count towards a banking license from 7 to 60 days52. Second Pillar: Regulatory Sandboxes According to the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance and Development, regulatory sandboxes are “a regulatory approach […] that allows live, time-bound testing of innovations under a regulator’s oversight. Novel financial products, technologies, and business models can be tested under a set of rules, supervision requirements, and appropriate safeguards53. This usually refers to not applying all or part of the current regulations so that business operators can test and verify new products and services using new technologies by first launching them on the market under certain conditions (period, location, scale restrictions, etc.). It is a system that rationally improves regulations based on data collected in the process. It enables to promote new technologies through limited demonstrations in the market while verifying safety issues caused by the technology in advance54. Empirical evidence from Cornelli et al. (2020) shows that sandboxes facilitate access to capital by reducing asymmetric information and regulatory costs. Although the exact mechanism that helps firms in a sandbox has not yet been identified, the positive effect of sandbox entry on capital raised is particularly pronounced for smaller and younger firms, considered more opaque and hence subject to more severe informational friction55. The regulatory sandbox introduced in 2017 allows deposits from the public without triggering a banking licence requirements as long as (Art. 6 Par. 2 BankV): the deposits accepted do not exceed CHF 1 million; no interest margin business is conducted; and depositors are informed, before making the deposit, that the person accepting the deposits is not supervised by FINMA and that the deposits are not covered by the Swiss depositor protection scheme56. Third Pillar: FinTech Licence57 Under a new banking licence category also called “Banking License Light”, FINMA may authorise companies that are not traditional banking companies to “accept deposits from the public up to a maximum threshold of CHF 100 million as long as deposits are not invested and no interest is paid on them”58. This new category alleviates a number of requirements around minimum capital, capital adequacy and liquidity, governance, and risk management with the aim of promoting innovation. Figure 359 Tax Competition While there are no specific taxation incentives uniquely targeted to the FinTech industry, the ordinary tax rate in Switzerland can be as low as 12%. This is a competitive, “business-friendly” rate (2.1): on average, OECD countries levy 21.7% corporate tax rate and the world average sits at 23.54%60. Further, start-ups who decide to locate their tax domicile in “structurally less developed regions”61 of Switzerland may benefit from a tax holiday on both the cantonal and federal level. There are also participation deductions for realised profit benefits under certain conditions. Swiss residents also do not have capital gains tax levied on private assets. Annual wealth taxes can be lessened for start-up investors if the companies are valued at their substance value, as may be done in the canton of Zurich62. Zug, the second most popular canton to set up operation for FinTechs levies en 11.9% rate on corporate taxes and a 0.07% tax rate on capital gains63.

The investment strategy is constructed based on client information and an investment algorithm, a set of predetermined rules created by investment professionals66. By exploiting this client data, the robo-advisor ensures that the portfolio is one that best fits its owner’s investment capacity, risk tolerance and ambitions. The algorithm drives the financial planning without human supervision67. The first robo-advisor was launched by Betterment68 in 2008 and since then, the industry has been increasingly growing. Until then, a financial advisor stood in the way between clients and automated portfolio allocation software, which has now, through the robo-advisory business model, been democratized. Indeed, robo-advisors are less expensive than traditional “human” advisors and can take on clients with much humbler means69. Inyova, a Swiss impact-investment firm, takes on robo-advisory clients for as little as CHF 2’000. These lower costs and lower fees are enabled by the automated investment strategies and auto-rebalancing of asset-allocations70, which, once the algorithm is finalized, require minimal human intervention. In Switzerland, robo-advisory has seen consistent growth since 2017. Statista estimates current Assets under management71 (AUM) at USD 5.7 billion, and projected to hike to USD 17.5 billion by 2026. In addition, AUM are expected to show an annual growth rate between 2022 and 2026 of 31.13% resulting in a projected total amount of USD 17.32 billion by 202672. Figure 573 4.1 Robo-Advisory Regulation, Recent Developments In this subchapter, we explore recent developments in financial markets law and their applications to robo-advisory. 4.1.1 FinSA The FinSA came into force on January 1, 2020. The law primarily regulates how financial services must be provided and how financial instruments must be offered. As such, wealth managers, wealtechs and robo-advisors are directly impacted by its introduction. It is a comprehension revision and expansion of the supervisory regime under financial market law, with a drive for standardization: “same business, same rules”74. According to Art. 1 Par. 1 FinSA “this Act seeks to protect the clients of financial service providers and to establish comparable conditions for the provision of financial services by financial service providers, and thus contributes to enhancing the reputation and competitiveness of Switzerland’s financial centre.” Thus three purposes emerge from the text of the law: To protect the clients (who are all creditors, investors and policyholders to whom a financial service provider provides such services75) To establish comparable conditions for the provision of financial services. And thus create a level playing field for financial service providers76 strengthening the reputation and competitiveness of the Swiss financial center Pursuant to Art. 2 FinSA, the following are subject to this Act, regardless of their legal form: financial service providers, client advisers, and producers and providers of financial instruments. FinTechs are considered to be financial service providers in the sense of FinSA because they are natural or legal persons who provide financial services on a commercial basis in Switzerland or for clients in Switzerland (Art. 3 Let. d FinSA). The criterion of a commercial basis is satisfied if there is an independent economic activity pursued on a permanent, for-profit basis (Art. 3 Let. d FinSA). Therefore, FinSA is applicable for FinTechs, and A.I.-based robo-advisors in particular77. However, it is essential to be aware of the fact that “companies or units of a group which provide financial services for other companies or units of the same group are not deemed to be financial service providers within the meaning of Art. 3 Let. d FinSA” (Art. 3 Par. 4 FinSO78). FinTechs operating in asset management can be represented by the following figure: Figure 679 Therefore, robo-advisors are considered to be financial service providers since they provide portfolio management services or, more rarely, investment advice80. The application of the FinSA does not require the FinTech company to obtain an authorization from the FINMA81. However, FinTech must now comply with several legal requirements before starting their activity, at the risk of being subject to criminal sanctions (Art. 89 et seq. FinSA). 4.1.1.1 Consequences of the Application of FinSA: through the lens of Robo-Advisory Client Segmentation, Art. 4 FinSA. Financial service providers must carry out a segmentation of their clients by classifying the persons who they provide such services to. The categories for segmentation are provided by the law: retail clients (Par. 2), professional clients (Par. 3) and institutional clients (al. 4). In Art. 4 Par. 2 FinSA, retail clients are defined in the negative as clients who are not professionals. In Art. 4 Par. 3 FinSA, professional clients are defined as “financial intermediaries as defined in the BA^[, the FinIA and the CISA; insurance companies as defined in the ISA; foreign clients subject to prudential supervision as the persons listed under a and b above; central banks; public entities with professional treasury operations; occupational pension schemes with professional treasury operations and other occupational pension institutions providing professional treasury operations; companies with professional treasury operations; large companies; private investment structures with professional treasury operations created for high-net-worth retail clients” In Art. 4 Par. 4 FinSA, institutional clients are defined as financial intermediaries as defined in the BA, the FinIA and the CISA82 ; insurance companies as defined in the ISA; foreign clients subject to prudential supervision as the persons listed under Let. a and b above and central banks as well as national and supranational public entities with professional treasury operations. Par. 7 of this provision provides for the possibility for financial service providers to waive the segmentation if they treat all their clients as retail clients. The segmentation system provided for in Art. 4 FinSA is not fixed83. Indeed, under certain conditions provided for in Art. 5 FinSA, clients can change their status. Information Duties, Art. 8 and 9 FinSA; Art. 6 et seq. FinSO. The service provider must comply with an information obligation. According to Art. 8 FinSA, the company must inform the client about itself and its financial services as well as about the associated risks. In particular, based on Art. 7 Par. 1 FinSO, the robo-advisor also has a duty to actively inform the customer about how robo-advisors work and the client must be informed about the objectives, the risks and the benefits of the robo-advisor. Likewise, in accordance with the same Article, the client must know that the investment decisions are based on algorithms that use the information provided by the client in the questionnaire during the onboarding process. Following the recommendation of Hirsch and Merlino (2022) , it is also certainly advisable that robo-advisors inform their clients that under certain conditions human intervention would be possible, for rebalancing the individual positions in the portfolio, such as in times of recessions and financial downturns84. If robo-advisors use not only traditional algorithms but also machine learning, Hirsch and Merlino (2022) believes that the client should be informed about this as well85 The information requirements (Art. 8 FinSA) aim to provide customers with a comprehensive overview of the services offered by the robo-advisor. The information can be provided on paper or electronically (Art. 9 Par. 3 FinSA). Establishment of Client Profile, Art. 12 FinSA; Art. 16 and 17 FinSO. In order to carry out the suitability test according to Art. 12 FinSA, the company must gather sufficient information about the client to create a client profile86. Art. 12 FinSA further defines that the robo-advisor must obtain information about the client’s prior knowledge and experience, income, overall financial situation, financial goals, investment horizon and risk tolerance. In practice, this means that the client must be provided with an appropriately designed questionnaire. The robo-advisor then creates the client profile based on the client’s answers from the aforementioned questionnaire. The questionnaire must capture the information necessary to assess the suitability of an investment strategy87. To do this, an algorithm is created that assigns the client to one of, for example, five categories based on a flying score for each individual answer to each question. The algorithm must separately assign the customer a score for two different categories: Risk Ability and Risk Preference. Therefore, when assigning points, it is important that the algorithm pays attention to whether the particular question counts toward risk capacity, which is based on the customer’s income and asset situation, or toward risk preference. It is also important that the algorithm does not allow risk overload. This would be the case if the risk appetite is higher than the risk capacity. In this particular instance, the risk capacity score must be used and the customer must be placed in the corresponding category. In this context, the quality of the questionnaire, the coherence of the information and the appropriate processing of the information must be ensured, as there should be no human intervention at this stage88. Based on the information provided by the client, the robo-advisor then proposes an investment strategy and also performs a suitability check (Art. 17 Par. 3 FinSO, Art. 13 and 14 FinSA). Art. 13 FinSA provides for an exemption from the verification obligation. If the services are limited to the execution or transmission of client orders, financial service providers are not obligated to perform an appropriateness or suitability assessment. ​​Art. 14 FinSA regulates non-assessability or lack of appropriateness or suitability. Thus, the financial service provider must inform before providing the service that he is not in a position to make the assessment, if he does not have the information necessary to assess the appropriateness or suitability (Par. 1). If, however, he has the information and believes that a financial instrument is not appropriate or suitable for the client, he must advise the client against it before providing the service (Par. 2). Matter of appropriateness (Art. 10 et seq. FinSA, Art. 16 et seq. FinSO.): When providing portfolio management services or investment advice considering the client’s entire portfolio, the firm must inquire about the client’s financial situation and investment objectives, as well as the client’s knowledge and experience. Documentation and Rendering of the Account, Art. 15 and 16 FinSA; Art. 18 and 19 FinSO. Art. 15 Par. 1 FinSA implies the following duties for the provider to document in an appropriate manner the financial services agreed with clients and the information collected about them (Let. a), the notification described in Art. 13 Par. 2 FinSA or the fact that they advised the clients in accordance with Art. 14 FinSA against availing of the service (Let. b) and the financial services provided for clients (Let. c). If so requested, financial service providers shall provide their clients with a copy of the documentation mentioned in Art. 15 FinSA or shall make it accessible to them in another appropriate manner (Art. 16 Par. 1 FinSA). Moreover, the Par. 2 provides that, at the clients’ request, they shall render account of the financial services agreed and provided (Let. a), the composition, valuation and development of the portfolio (Let. b) and the costs associated with the financial services (Let. c). In addition, according to Art. 18 FinSO, the robo-advisor must be able to account to a client within ten business days of the client requesting their documentation. Furthermore, all documentation must be retained for at least ten years (Art. 18 FinSO). Among other things, the FinSA requires firms to record the information collected from clients and the services agreed with and provided to them and the results of suitability and appropriateness reviews(Art. 15 et seq., FinSA.). Other requirements. The financial service provider has an obligation to respect the principles of transparency and diligence regarding client orders (Art. 17 FinSA and 20 FinSO ; Art. 18 FinSA and 21 et seq. FinSO). Moreover, ​​the financial service provider must comply with the organizational requirements set out in Art. 21 et seq. FinSA. 4.1.2 FinIA The FinIA does not contain any specific rules regarding FinTech. This implies that the conditions of application are the same for all regardless of the technology used (principle of innovative-neutrality). FinIA’s objective, according to Art. 1 Par. 2 FinIA,“ is to protect the investors and clients of financial institutions and ensure the proper functioning of the financial market”. On reading this provision, one can see that a further purpose is to regulate uniformly the requirements imposed on financial institutions who invest and manage the assets of others in the conduct of their business89. Pursuant to art. 2 Par. 1 FinIA, the law regulates 5 types of financial institutions which are the following : portfolio managers ; trustees ; managers of collective assets ; fund management companies ; securities firms. Paragraph 2 lists the persons excluded from the scope of the law. Therefore, to examine the application of the FinIA for Fintech operating in asset management as a commercial operation, it is necessary to distinguish between portfolio management and investment advice. Indeed, only the portfolio managers are subject to the FinIA (Art. 12 Par. 1 Let. a FinIA)90. This way, FinTechs operating in asset management can be represented by the following figure: Figure 7 Figure 791 If FinTech operates a robo advisor that directly makes an investment decision resulting from the advice given by the algorithm, it is considered to be an asset manager within the meaning of Art. 17 FinIA. In this case the law applies if the FinTech acts in a professional way and not in a private way (see Art. 19 Par. 1 OEFin), which is generally the case 92. The consequence of falling under this law is that portfolio managers are required to obtain a license form FINMA since they are financial institutions (Art. 5 Par. 1 FinIA). However, robo-advisors that only provide investment advice must enter the register of advisors (Art. 28 et seq. FinSA) but they are not required to obtain a license and/or prudential supervision 93. If a license is required, portfolio managers (and trustees) must be subject to a supervisory organisation in accordance with Art. 43a FINMASA and must be able to provide proof of this in order to apply for a license (Art. 7 (2) FinIA). Art. 6 FinIA provides a cascading authorisation that allows a company, which has a more restrictive type of authorization to obtain, to carry out the authorized activities under more flexible conditions 94. Thus, “authorisation to operate as a manager of collective assets also authorises an entity to operate as a portfolio manager” (Art. 6 (4) FinIA). The FinTech will have to respect all the obligations that result from these cascading authorizations95. The conditions of authorization are found in Art. 7 et seq. FinIA and 17 et seq. FinIA. 4.1.3 FADP From September 2023, the new revised Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) will come into force with important provisions governing the processing of personal data. The FADP’s main objective is to strengthen data subjects’ self-determination in relation to their data. The FADP is largely based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been adopted by the EU and has been in effect since 25 May 201896. The FADP is crucial for Swiss FinTech startups, especially for WealthTech Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) since their operations are data-heavy. In the case of robo-advisory, questionnaires and investment decisions are made online which raises several data protection concerns regarding these automated portfolio management services called ‘Automated Individual Decision-Making (ADM)’. ADM, which already was featured in the GDPR, is one of the new concepts that is included in the FADP. Unlike the GDPR, the FADP does not provide for a general obligation to obtain consent. Such an obligation is only imposed for high-risk profiling.97. Under Swiss and European law (Art. 22 GDPR; Art. 21 FADP), ADM is deemed to exist if the following three conditions are met: It must be an individualized decision; The decision must be made without any human involvement (‘based solely on automated processing’); The decision must produce legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affect her. Considering the typical robo-advisor’s onboarding process, these three conditions are met, since it handles (1) one client per process, (2) there is no human intervention, and (3) each investment decision made by an algorithm consists in selling or buying financial instruments in the name and on behalf of the client98. GDPR prohibits ADM by stating that any “data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling” (Hirsch and Merlino 2022 , p.41). Unlike GDPR, Swiss law does not prohibit ADM, and only imposes appropriate safeguards and the duty to inform the data subject (Hirsch and Merlino 2022 , p.44). Under the FADP, no “legal basis” (so-called “justification”, i.e. the Swiss equivalent of the European legal basis under Art. 6 and 9 GDPR) is in principle required to lawfully process personal data. Thus, a justification is only required if the processing of personal data results in a violation of the personality of the data subjects (Art. 30 Par. 2 FADP). The most notable difference between FADP and GDPR is that FADP treats the process of the profile differently by the intensity of risk. Under the FADP, a valid consent is one that is given voluntarily upon provision of adequate information (“informed consent”). It is effective if it was given prior to the processing. However, the implied consent does not apply to sensitive personal data or profiling “involving a high risk” (i.e. profiling that results in a personality profile and carries a high risk of negative consequences for the data subject)99 . In our interview, both startups (Relai AG and Descartes AG) outsource client data storage or general data management. According to Julian Liniger, the CEO of Relai AG, since data storage of FinTech SMEs is easy to be audited, RegTech (Regulation + Technology) startups (e.g. Know Your Customer (KYC)Spider) help to keep the onboarding process and KYC process as lean as possible. Descartes AG also would like to focus on their primary business, client services, by outsourcing cloud data services to the RegTech firm. 4.2 Case Study: A.I.-driven Processes Robo-advisors differ by institution, based on their underlying algorithm. However, their implementation steps are consistently the same. Clients first complete a questionnaire to assess risk tolerance, investment ambition and needs. Based on this information, the robo-advisor builds a diversified portfolio based on an algorithm, a set of predefined rules, created by investment professionals. These investment professionals monitor market signals and ensure that the algorithm is rebalancing the portfolio appropriately100. We have created a Python pseudocode to illustrate the mechanism by which the robo-advisor categorizes the client, assigns a portfolio and rebalances it. Note that we have only used a very naive questionnaire, which in reality would not comply with the revised FinSA, as we do not distinguish between risk capacity and risk preference. This step would be needed to prevent any risk oversteering. In practice, this may be done by using the lowest score between risk capacity and preference for the final risk category assignment. The AI-portfolio attribution process has been highly simplified, with investment strategies consisting of simple bond to equity ratios. 4.2.1 Risk categories First, 5 risk categories are defined. Each one corresponds to an investment strategy that the client will be assigned to by the robo-advisor. # Defining risk categories def investment_recommendation(): risk_levels = { &#39;Conservative&#39;: &#39;80% bonds, 20% equities&#39;, &#39;Balanced&#39;: &#39;60% bonds, 40% equities&#39;, &#39;Growth&#39;: &#39;40% bonds, 60% equities&#39;, &#39;Opportunistic&#39;: &#39;20% bonds, 80% equities&#39;, &#39;All Equity&#39;: &#39;0% bonds, 100% equities&#39;, } 4.2.2 Questionnaire Current trends in the robo-advisory industry show questionnaires are generally being shortened to make robo-advisory solutions more attractive to new clients. However, enough questions need to be asked to correctly identify the client’s risk capacity and risk preference and to comply with regulations such as the FinSA. For simplicity, we have included 10 questions in the following pseudocode, which are inspired by several leading Swiss robo-advisors101. # Questions class risk_profile: q1 = (&quot;1. Please enter your age&quot;, choices = [ (&#39;0&#39;, &#39;More than 60&#39;), (&#39;2&#39;, &#39;Between 51 and 60&#39;), (&#39;5&#39;, &#39;Between 41 and 50&#39;), (&#39;8&#39;, &#39;Between 31 and 40&#39;), (&#39;10&#39;, &#39;30 or younger&#39;)]) q2 = (&quot;2.

Which of the following would you have done if your portfolio experiences a 50% loss?&quot;, choices = [ (&#39;0&#39;, &#39;Sell all investments&#39;), (&#39;2&#39;, &quot;Move all investments into bonds&quot;), (&#39;5&#39;, &#39;Change to a more conservative allocation&#39;), (&#39;8&#39;, &#39;Hold on to investments&#39;), (&#39;10&#39;, &quot;Investeven more&quot;)]) q10 = (&quot;10. As return increases so does risk. Which statement applies to you?&quot;, choices = [ (&#39;0&#39;, &quot;I am not willing to accept any fluctuations in value&quot;), (&#39;2&#39;, &quot;I can live with fluctuations between 0% to 5%&quot;), (&#39;5&#39;, &quot;Value fluctuations between 5% and 10% are fine&quot;), (&#39;8&#39;, &quot;I can accept fluctuations between 10% and 20%&quot;), (&#39;10&#39;, &quot;Even fluctuations over 20% are fine for me&quot;)]) 4.2.3 Point distribution After collecting the relevant client information and attributing a score, the robo-advisor classifies the customer into one of five risk categories. # Traditional Risk Profile def new_risk_profile(): form = risk_profile() if Sum &lt; 20: risk_profile = &quot;Conservative&quot; elif Sum &gt;= 20 and Sum &lt; 40: risk_profile = &quot;Balanced&quot; elif Sum &gt;= 40 and Sum &lt; 60: risk_profile = &quot;Growth&quot; elif Sum &gt;= 60 and Sum &lt;= 80: risk_profile = &quot;Opportunistic&quot; else: risk_profile = &quot;All Equity&quot; return result 4.2.4 Portfolio Recommendation In this next step, the robo-advisor makes an investment strategy. Two requirements are added: first, the client must be at least 18 years old and not yet retired to become a client with our company. Second, the minimum investment amount is CHF 2,000; in line with Inyova. We have also added a small feature that allows the algorithm to automatically combine our recommended investment portfolio if the above two requirements are met. One should note that these investment strategies are, in practice, the fruit of careful optimization algorithms based on (in the case of Switzerland) stocks which are listed on the Swiss Market Index (SMI) and bonds and/or an exchange-traded funds (ETF). # Final Recommendation def portfolio_recommendation(): first_name = [&quot;First_Name&quot;] age = [&quot;Age&quot;] investment_amount = [&quot;Investment_Amount&quot;] if age &lt; 18: return build_validation_result(&quot;You need to be at least 18 years old to use our service&quot;) elif age &gt;= 65: return build_validation_result(&quot;You must not be retired yet&quot;) if investment_amount &lt; 5000: return build_validation_result(&quot;The minimum investment amount is CHF 5&#39;000&quot;) 4.2.5 Rebalancing Finally, we come to portfolio rebalancing. In order to keep the risk level chosen by the client constant, the algorithm of the following pseudo-code102 must periodically adjust the allocation of each position within the investment portfolio. Starting from a predefined allocation overview of all components of the investment portfolio, the algorithm will check whether the actual allocation in the portfolio still matches the target allocation. Deviations occur simply due to stock price increases/decreases. If discrepancies exist, either automated purchases or sales of the stocks are ordered. # Define target portfolio target_portfolio = { &quot;AAPL&quot;: 30.00, &quot;IBM&quot;: 40.00, &quot;AMZN&quot;: 25.00, &quot;Cash&quot;: 5.00 } # Define example portfolio which needs to be rebalanced portfolio = { &quot;AAPL&quot;: 40.00, &quot;IBM&quot;: 35.00, &quot;AMZN&quot;: 20.00, &quot;CASH&quot;: 5.00 } # Set tolerance value in % tolerance = 5.00 # Iterate over all stocks in our current portfolio for i in portfolio: # Calculate the total value of our portfolio (including cash) if i == Cash: total_value += portfolio[i] continue total_value += price * portfolio[i] # Record which stocks need to be rebalanced rebalance_needed = dict() for i in target_portfolio: # Rebalance needed if: difference between example and target portfolio is greater than tolerance difference = ((prices[i] * portfolio[i]) / total_value) - target_portfolio[i] if (difference) &gt; tolerance: rebalance_needed[i] = difference # Now we can rebalance the portfolio while rebalance_needed: quantity = int((target_portfolio[ticker] * (total_value / prices[ticker])) - portfolio[ticker]) References "],["dlt-based-fintechs-market-and-regulation.html", " 5 DLT-Based FinTechs: Market and Regulation 5.1 The Crypto-Valley Success Story 5.2 The Blockchain Act", " 5 DLT-Based FinTechs: Market and Regulation Switzerland’s success story as a FinTech hub depends in large part on DLT-based FinTechs, indeed 11 of its unicorns are companies operating in the blockchain technology segment103. DLT is the second largest technology segment in the FinTech market in Switzerland, according to the 2022 IFZ FinTech Study104. The study enumerates 113 DLT-based companies in 2021. However, companies falling into the DLT area are those which, for example, “offer payment systems for cryptocurrencies or loan platforms in the area of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)”, and only 63 DLT-backed companies with headquarters in Zug are included in this study. These numbers pale in comparison to the total 960 Crypto-Valley companies operating in Switzerland, including 433 based in Zug105. In fact, crypto/crypto-assets and related blockchain companies are a unique segment of FinTech that doesn’t always enter the study’s scope. This chapter tells the story of blockchain-based FinTechs in Switzerland, and details its unique regulation to serve as a contrast to that of other FinTechs in Switzerland, and A.I.-based WealthTechs in particular. 5.1 The Crypto-Valley Success Story The development of what is today known as Crypto Valley all began with advantageous corporate tax rates. In 2012, 1 in 16 new Swiss companies registered in Zug, with the main appeal being its corporate tax rate106, then about half the national average. At that time,107 the tax levy on corporate profit is 15% for ordinary, and 8.8% for privileged companies. Almost all of the levied tax went to the federal government since cantonal and communal rates in Zug were -and remain- close to 0%. Beyond corporate tax rates at the time, individual taxes were around 23% in Zug, compared to 40% in France, Germany and Italy and 50% in Britain, Austria and the Netherlands. In 2013, the Crypto Valley earns its name when digital notary Bitcoin (BTC) Suisse and Monetas108 move their operations to Zug for tax purposes and favourable ICO laws109 . The notoriety of the area became international when then 23-year-old Vitalik Buterin moved the Ethereum Foundation to Zug (worth today CHF 157.2 billion 110, the most valuable company in crypto-space in Switzerland) and triggered an overnight influx of start-ups operating in the same space. According to the Top 50 VC CV report111, the figures we see in Switzerland make it the “most mature blockchain hub” in the world. The attractiveness of the valley goes beyond favourable tax rates and also includes a favourable regulatory framework and pro-activity from the government. For example, Zug was the first city in the world to accept payments in BTC, and FINMA granted full banking licenses to two crypto-banks, Seba and Sygnum112. 5.2 The Blockchain Act “With the newly introduced Blockchain legislation, Switzerland boasts one of the world’s most advanced Blockchain legislations and has thus created a strong and solid foundation for the future prosperity of Crypto Valley.” – Ralf Kubli, CV VC Top 50 Report Author “In five or ten years’ time I don’t want people to be talking about Crypto Valley Zug. I want people to be talking about Crypto Nation Switzerland.” – Swiss Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann, January 2018 “As of next year, Switzerland will have a regulatory framework that is among the most advanced in the world” – Heinz Tännler, President of the Swiss Blockchain Federation On September 25th 2020, the Parliament passed the Federal Act on the Adaptation of Federal Law to Developments in Distributed Electronic Register Technology (DLTA)113, commonly known as the “Blockchain Act”. The Act is a legislative package impacting different federal-level laws114 ranging from securities trading to bankruptcy and was welcomed with open arms by the DLT industry. The blanket ordinance mandates the legal adjustments in ten ordinances with the aim of “[improving] the conditions for blockchain and DLT companies in Switzerland, thereby making the country an international pioneer in modern regulation of innovative financial market technologies”115. A first portion of the adopted amendments came into force on February 1st 2021 (amendments to the Swiss Code of Obligations), and a second on August 1st 2021. In particular, the new laws address the segregation of digital assets in case of bankruptcy, and access to data and personal information116. These new rules become one of “the most advanced in the world” according to Heinz Tännler, by providing clarity in otherwise legally vague situations, which effectively increases the security of clients. Further, DLT securities have now entered the Swiss Code of Obligations117 as “registered uncertified securities”. These securities no longer require a signed cession for their transfer to be legal, and do not require a central securities depository. These measures should significantly improve companies’ “ability (…) to issue instruments representing equity or debt, significantly reducing the cost and effort of raising capital. They are also expected to improve liquidity by making the transfer and secondary trading of DLT Securities easier and more directly and broadly accessible”118.

Indeed, the United Kingdom shares a similar banking history with Switzerland and occupies the 7th place in IFZ’s FinTech hub ranking in 2022 (Ankenbrand et al. 2022). The comparison is further motivated by the fact Switzerland and the United Kingdom are the largest financial centers in Europe and share a forward-looking vision of the world in terms of innovation119. We go into detail about the United Kingdom’s FinTech market, its legislative landscape and its corporate tax and sandbox regimes. 6.1 FinTechs in the United Kingdom Over the last decade, the United Kingdom and London in particular have become a global FinTech hub, with 18% of worldwide funding for FinTechs raised on its soil. This number is topped only by the United States, with 47% of global FinTech funding raised (Cornelli et al. 2020). As did Switzerland (1.1.1), the United Kingdom had a record year in annual FinTech investment in 2021, exceeding USD 11.6b, representing a huge 217% increase from the previous year120. The United Kingdom has a particularly strong WealthTech and payments technology industry, together accounting for more than 50% of the market. While London is the hub of the industry within the kingdom, wealtech is particularly active in the city, with 77% of this business segment being based there. A second WealthTech cluster can also be found in Scotland121. 6.2 Regulatory Landscape The United Kingdom government has articulated its goal to make the United Kingdom the world capital of FinTechs. Thus, it is really supportive of innovation and development of FinTechs in the territory122. As in Switzerland, in the United Kingdom there is no specific regulatory framework for FinTech companies. Thus, they are subject to the existing body of United Kingdom financial regulation. It will therefore be necessary to look at each law to see if it is likely to apply to the FinTech business. Therefore, the question of whether a particular activity is regulated can be complex123. If a FinTech wishes to undertake activities that are regulated then it will need to obtain authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) which provide regulatory oversight of financial services in the UK124. After the FinTech has obtained authorization from the authority, additional primary legislation will apply, as well as detailed regulations issued by the FCA and PRA125. Corporate Taxation The corporate taxation rates in the United Kingdom are defined during the Budget sessions. Under the current budget, the normal taxation rate of 19% will remain in force until the end of the fiscal year 2022126. There are no special tax regimes depending on size or profits. If taxable profits are attributable to patents, however, a tax rate of 10% applies. This may indeed be the case for WealthTechs with patented algorithms. The banking industry also sees a particular exception of an 8% supplementary tax on profits exceeding GBP 25 million 127. According to Spring Budget 2021128, for businesses with profits exceeding GBP 250’000 the main taxation rate will rise from 19% to 25% with effect from April 1st 2023. 19% will remain applicable for businesses with revenues thereunder and businesses with profits below GBP 50’000 will benefit from small profits rates. Start-ups and tech companies, can also benefit from certain tax relief schemes129: Entrepreneur’s relief: a possible reduction in capital gains tax from 20% to 10% on the sale of the entrepreneur’s business on up to GBP 1 million of gains Enterprise Management Incentive: companies may offer share options to make the companies’ tax term more efficient and boost productivity of the enterprise Enterprise investment schemes: offering tax relief up to 30% of value of their investment to investors of riskier trading companies Research and Development (R&amp;D) regime: significant innovation in science and tech is rewarded with deductions in profits to lower taxable basis Patent box regime: aforementioned 10% tax rate on profits attributable to patents 6.3 Sandbox Regime The regulatory sandbox in the United Kingdom is one of the important channels making it a FinTech hub. The regime was first introduced by the United Kingdom’s FCA in November 2015 (Fahy 2022) and was subsequently introduced in about 60 countries130. While WealthTechs have been the dominant business segment in the industry, the United Kingdom is trying to become a cryptocurrency hub by making Stablecoins a recognized and valid payment method. By 2023, the United Kingdom will develop a Finance Market Structure (FMI) Sandbox to support firms wanting to innovate, especially targeting DLT technology. Under this new FMI sandbox, participants can request exemptions from or modifications to existing legislation to facilitate testing of DLT in FMIs and enable the United Kingdom authorities to gain a better understanding of the legislative changes necessary to accommodate DLT131. From August 2021, the United Kingdom’s regulatory sandbox moved to an always-open model, allowing firms to submit their applications throughout the year. Firms can now access FCA’s testing services at any point throughout the year, at the right point in their development lifecycle, at a time that works the best for them132. According to the FCA, the eligibility criteria for the United Kingdom’s regulatory sandbox test are following133: In scope: whether the customer base is located in the United Kingdom Genuine Innovation: whether the business proposal exhibits genuine difference Consumer benefit: whether the business benefits the consumer Readiness: whether the innovation is mature enough to be tested on the market Need for support: whether the sandbox regime is genuinely needed Sandboxes have been very effective in the United Kingdom. Empirical evidence from Cornelli et al. (2020) shows that firms entering the sandbox between 2014 and 2019 see an increase of 15% in capital raised post-entry; their probability of raising capital increases by 50%. By reducing asymmetric information and regulatory costs, the sandbox facilitates access to capital (Cornelli et al. 2020 , p.26). References "],["voices-from-the-industry.html", " 7 Voices from the Industry 7.1 Descartes Finance AG 7.2 House of Satoshi 7.3 Relai AG", " 7 Voices from the Industry In this section, we relay some of the main lessons learned when interviewing actors of the Zurich FinTech scene. Each one of their full interviews is available through a hyperlink. 7.1 Descartes Finance AG Dr. Adriano Lucatelli is the CEO and co-founder of the digital-only asset management firm Descartes Finance AG, a leading robo-advisory firm in Switzerland. This firm belongs to the business area of Investment Management and is A.I.-based. View the full interview here “Regulation should primarily try to prevent macroeconomic financial shocks, not regulate every single process in the financial industry.” – Dr. Adriano Lucatelli The newly introduced legislation (2.1) has come with higher requirements for operation and created significant barriers to entry for start-ups operating in wealth management. However, many WealthTechs134 are based on A.I., which should allow human bias in wealth management and allow wealth managers to focus on relationship building. As such, while these new regulations might be necessary for large institutional wealth managers, they do not improve processes or client protection for robo-advisory firms. On the contrary; these new requirements increase the cost of doing business, and divert means -that could have otherwise been invested- towards internal function. In particular, FinSA increased compliance costs for the start-up Dr. Lucatelli firmly believes this does not contribute to increased client protection, but rather reduces the firm’s investment capital. The introduction of FinSA can be measured by opportunity cost: for the same amount spent on compliance yearly, Dr. Lucatelli affirms he could have hired one developer or salesperson. These increased costs have a direct negative effect on innovation: less money for R&amp;D and, since firms must now be compliant to operate, higher barriers to entry for start-ups. Finally, Dr. Lucatelli thinks having industry-specific incentives such as sandbox regimes is not helpful. He rather see overall regulation be loosened, and have the responsibility be shifted to the client base, instead of attempting to protect them at all costs. 7.2 House of Satoshi Rino Borini is the Co-founder and CEO of Scarossa, an independent consulting and media company, and the House of Satoshi, the home of Bitcoin. He is also on the board of Descartes Finance AG, which gives him a perspective from both the DLT and WealthTech sides. View the full interview here To Borini, the sandbox and “banking license lights” created by FINMA have the potential to foster innovation, but this potential is hindered by the time and resources that are required for startups to obtain their license before beginning their activity. This process should be accelerated and simplified. Borini finds the Swiss DLT laws very modern and thinks they will foster technological development in the crypto economy. In his opinion, FINMA seems to deviate from its technology-neutral policy style by regulating DLT explicitly. This specific regulation sometimes reveals unfavourable conditions for FinTech, such as a withdrawal limit for crypto-currencies set at CHF 1’000. To him, this leads to the dampening of innovation, and he doubts Switzerland can rightfully fill the boots of “Blockchain Nation Switzerland”. Borini views the future positively and thinks Switzerland has the potential to maintain a leading role internationally. Regulators should work closer to industries, and regulations should be updated more often to match the changing circumstances. FINMA should not try to push innovation on the industry, but rather allow for innovation to flourish by itself. FINMA also requires a power team of industry leaders, as well as a start-up community they are willing to actively listen when problems are identified. 7.3 Relai AG Julian Liniger is the Co-Founder and CEO of Relai AG, Europe’s easiest Bitcoin Investment App. Relai is a bitcoin wallet management app, operating on DLT. View the full interview here Liniger shared the fact that the generous laws surrounding DLT are what made Relai AG possible. According to him, the regulatory situation in Switzerland is more favourable than that in Europe, and he is able to operate Relai based in Switzerland but has a Europe-wide client base. In particular, Switzerland is known to have a comparatively slow legislative process, which Liniger appreciates. This gives the industry enough time to adjust to new incoming laws. To Liniger, Switzerland is very innovation-friendly. He really appreciates the sandbox environment and the FinTech License that FinTech may benefit from. Including robo-advisory firms.↩︎ "],["conclusion.html", " 8 Conclusion", " 8 Conclusion Thanks to its developed banking and financial industry, stable politics, access to talent and attractivity as a living and working country, Switzerland has been able to use its strategic capabilities and build up its reputation in the FinTech industry (1). Its overall ranking is certainly skewed by some luck and competitive taxation (3.1), but the Confederation has also attributed this success to its innovation-friendly and technology agnostic regulatory style (1.1.2). Recent developments in financial markets laws (2.1), namely the introduction of FinSA, FinIA and the FADP, do however seem to deviate from the aforementioned principles, innovation-friendliness in particular. These laws, rather than restrict activity, impose higher requirements for financial service companies. This is done through amendments forcing regulatory compliance before beginning their activity under penalty of law (FinSA), imposing a need for authorization through FINMA (FinIA) and imposing higher data protection laws (FADP). While these new regulations are aimed at improving client protection, their direct effect is an increase in running costs for all market actors - the consequence of which is higher barriers to entry. This makes already operational players more comfortable due to a smaller incoming competition threat, but also adversely affects the market by hindering innovation. The associated cost increase is also likely to asymmetrically burden start-ups, where innovation is usually concentrated. Other departures of the regulatory “same business, same laws” and technology-agnostic style are to be highlighted within the FinTech industry. FinTech operating with business plans similar to those of banks benefit from a number of incentives including a regulatory sandbox and a FinTech license light (1.1.2), incentives that don’t apply to all FinTech businesses and allow for different requirements to be applied to different businesses. Selective improvements in the law have also been made in record time for distributed ledger technology (3.2), although the federal government deemed the then-current legislation sufficient. These improvements come in stark contrast to the higher barriers to entry that robo advisory firms are being faced with. Finally, Switzerland’s position as the FinTech hub of Europe is one it may need to fight to keep. With the exception of main corporate taxation, the regulation in the United Kingdom we’ve put forward has proven more FinTech friendly, in particular with an open sandbox regime strategy catered to any innovative company ready to jump into the market (4.4). In comparison, Switzerland’s sandbox regime is rife with bureaucracy and licensing costs. The position of Switzerland, both in FinTech and innovation rankings, is especially threatened by the United Kingdom’s new target: DLT-based FinTechs. With their specially targeted FMI box, they could poach innovative start-ups trying to test their business plan and are not only using Zug as a tax haven. True Swiss innovation must be created from within, not move to Switzerland for tax purposes. Switzerland has to foster real innovation for FinTechs by striking a balance between necessary regulation and leaving enough room for play to take full advantage of the capabilities it possesses. Whether this takes the form of deregulation or an increase in technology sensitivity is out of the scope of this paper, but is something industry actors feel strongly about.
