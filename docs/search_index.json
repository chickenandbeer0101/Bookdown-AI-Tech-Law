It goal, as declared by the government, is to “create a level playing field, boost the competitiveness of the financial centre and improve client protection”. Switzerland is a breeding ground for the FinTech scene. According to Michael Page, 10% of all global European FinTech enterprises are located in Switzerland, with 46% of them located in Zurich. As such, the regulatory environment of Switzerland and changes affecting it is a topic of interest. In our research, we would like to address the following questions using the Swiss fintech startup Descartes Finance, which is one of the leading robo-advisors in the field of digital asset management and digital pensions and was affected in many ways by the introduction of FinSA: as a case-study.

This has led to a wider range of financial products and services being offered more efficiently and effectively, and companies are under competitive pressure to become more consumer-centric. However, the increasing use of fintech solutions and new technologies also entails risks to which regulators and supervisory authorities are reacting. In this chapter, we aim to analyse the consequences of regulations for startups, whether they are justified, whether they really achieve the desired effect, and ultimately what impact they have on the economy as a whole. To this end, we conducted several interviews with CEOs of fintech companies in Switzerland to get first-hand opinions from those most directly affected by new regulations. Chapter 2 is thus divided into the following subchapters. First, using the example of the adoption of the Financial Services Law (FinSA), which was introduced in 2018 and came into force on January 1, 2020, we analyse the immediate consequences for startups resulting from the implementation of the new regulations. In a second step, which we will later refer to as “Voices from the Industry,” we ask industry professionals what they personally think of new regulations. Specifically, we asked Dr. Adriano Lucatelli, CEO and Co-Founder of Descartes Finance AG and Julian Liniger, CEO and Co-Founder of Relai AG.
