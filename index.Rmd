# Abstract

FinTech is a portmanteau for the words “Financial” and “Technology” and is used to describe “technology-based solutions for innovative digital products, services and processes in the financial sector”^[“FinTech in Switzerland : Fewer companies, more volume”, accessed 27 April 2022, https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-university-of-applied-sciences-and-arts/about-us/media/medienmitteilungen/2022/03/09/FinTech-studie-2022/.]. FinTech companies usually distinguish themselves from traditional financial institutions by taking technologically innovative approaches to complement or replace financial services. 

Switzerland is particularly well developed in the financial industry and has earned the reputation of being a trustworthy and innovative financial hub. Together with a technology-neutral and innovation-friendly regulatory approach, it has created a fertile ground for a world-class FinTech centre to develop. In fact, Zurich and Geneva currently rank as the second and fourth FinTech hubs in the world^[@IFZ_FinTech_Study2022 , p. 26.] . In 2021, 384^[“FinTech in Switzerland : Fewer companies, more volume, accessed 27 April 2022, https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-university-of-applied-sciences-and-arts/about-us/media/medienmitteilungen/2022/03/09/FinTech-studie-2022/.] FinTech companies are operating in Switzerland, and among them are 14 unicorns^[“Swiss ‘Crypto Valley’ boasts 14 ‘unicorns’”, accessed 27 April 2022, https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss--crypto-valley--boasts-14--unicorns-/47291870.] (including 11 based on distributed ledger technology (DLT-technology)) and every tenth FinTech startup is founded in Switzerland^[“Switzerland’s FinTech sector is flourishing”, accessed 27 April 2022, https://www.michaelpage.ch/advice/market-updates/switzerlands-FinTech-sector-flourishing.]. 

In this booklet, we explore the Swiss FinTech scene and its regulation through the lens of robo-advisory, an artificial intelligence (A.I.)-based asset manager. To this end, we begin by giving a general introduction about FinTechs and their regulation in Switzerland (Chapter 1). We then detail recent developments in regulation that have affected robo-advisory, namely FinSA, FinIA, and FADP, and provide pseudocode for a simplified robo-advisor (Chapter 2). To bring nuance to our discussion, we explore recent developments in distributed ledger technology (Chapter 3), as well as the current state of regulation in Europe’s second FinTech hub, the United Kingdom (Chapter 4). We finally looked at the voice of the industry and more specifically at three Zurich based FinTechs: Descartes Finance AG, Relai AG as well as House of Satoshi that we had the honor to interview (Chapter 5). In this last chapter we provide cut and uncut footage of our conversations with the CEOs of these FinTechs.
