## EXAMPLE OF FINSA

FinSA

The FinSA came into force on January 1, 2020. The law primarily regulates how financial services must be provided and how financial instruments must be offered. As such, wealth managers, wealtechs and robo-advisors are directly impacted by its introduction. It is a comprehension revision and expansion of the supervisory regime under financial market law, with a drive for standardization: “same business, same rules”^[@Ankenbrand2017 , p. 14.]. 

According to Art. 1 Par. 1 FinSA “this Act seeks to protect the clients of financial service providers and to establish comparable conditions for the provision of financial services by financial service providers, and thus contributes to enhancing the reputation and competitiveness of Switzerland's financial centre.”

The criterion of a commercial basis is satisfied if there is an independent economic activity pursued on a permanent, for-profit basis (Art. 3 Let. d FinSA). Therefore, FinSA is applicable for FinTechs, and A.I.-based robo-advisors in particular^[@Favrod2021, p. 207]. However, it is essential to be aware of the fact that “companies or units of a group which provide financial services for other companies or units of the same group are not deemed to be financial service providers within the meaning of Art. 3 Let. d FinSA” (Art. 3 Par. 4 FinSO^[Ordinance on Financial Services of June 6th, 2019 (“FinSO”; CC 950.11.)]).
