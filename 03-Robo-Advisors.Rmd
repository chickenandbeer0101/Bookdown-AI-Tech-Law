This has led to a wider range of financial products and services being offered more efficiently and effectively, and companies are under competitive pressure to become more consumer-centric. However, the increasing use of fintech solutions and new technologies also entails risks to which regulators and supervisory authorities are reacting.

To this end, we conducted several interviews with CEOs of fintech companies in Switzerland to get first-hand opinions from those most directly affected by new regulations. Chapter 2 is thus divided into the following subchapters. First, using the example of the adoption of the Financial Services Law (FinSA), which was introduced in 2018 and came into force on January 1, 2020, we analyse the immediate consequences for startups resulting from the implementation of the new regulations. In a second step, which we will later refer to as "Voices from the Industry," we ask industry professionals what they personally think of new regulations. Specifically, we asked Dr. Adriano Lucatelli, CEO and Co-Founder of Descartes Finance AG and Julian Liniger, CEO and Co-Founder of Relai AG. Rino Borini ...   ADD TEXT HERE
