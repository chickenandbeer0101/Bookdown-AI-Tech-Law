## Citation and Footnotes Check
We will create footnotes for **Articles** like so.^[Art. 15, FinSA]

The same magic for **Website links**, simply put inside footnote.^[https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/corporate/2021/april/relationship-building-the-signif.html] 

@Ankenbrand2017 is here used as an example citation.

Or use citation at the end of sentence [@Ankenbrand2017].

Links are addes as follows: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
