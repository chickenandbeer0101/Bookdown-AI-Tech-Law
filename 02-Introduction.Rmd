## Test Citation

FinTech is a portmanteau for the words “Financial” and “Technology” and is used to describe “technology-based solutions for innovative digital products, services and processes in the financial sector”^[Fintech in Switzerland: Fewer companies, more volume2022]. FinTech companies usually distinguish themselves from traditional financial institutions by taking technologically innovative approaches to complement or replace financial services. 




## Citation and Footnotes Check
We will create footnotes for **Articles** like so.^[Art. 15, FinSA]

The same magic for **Website links**, simply put inside footnote.^[https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/corporate/2021/april/relationship-building-the-signif.html] 

@Ankenbrand2017 is here used as an example citation.

Or use citation at the end of sentence [@Ankenbrand2017].

Links are added as follows: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

### Including page numbers in citations

For more specific citations inlcuding page number, maybe add as a footnote?^[@Ankenbrand2017, p.420]. 

@Ankenbrand2017 ^[p. 420-421] is again used. 

Or if you prefer like this [@Ankenbrand2017 , p.20].

Or: Maybe you prefer like this [@Ankenbrand2017]^[@Ankenbrand2017 , p.420].
